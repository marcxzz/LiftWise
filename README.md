# üìö LiftWise

LiftWise is a web service designed to simplify the management of gym memberships and reservations. With an intuitive interface, any user can sign up, subscribe and renew subscriptions, as well as book admission to different fitness centers without any difficulty.

## üß± System Analysis

In analyzing the first version of the project, we identified the following entities:

- Users
- Gyms
- Memberships
- Reservations

The **User** is the primary actor in the system: it is assigned a unique system-generated identifier, along with master and login information. Among such information, the email address plays a crucial role because it serves as the login and must therefore be unique across the platform, while first and last name can safely be repeated among distinct profiles. Each time a User subscribes to a **Membership**, a Membership record is created that tracks its validity period. The same User can have multiple Membership of the same type as long as the dates do not overlap (this will be handled by backend logic).

The concept of **Gym** is equally central: each gym receives a unique identifier and maintains descriptive attributes such as name, address, and maximum capacity. The uniqueness constraint applies to the combination of name and address, so as to avoid duplicate master records while still allowing multiple facilities to carry the same name if located in different locations (will be handled by backend logic). Gyms serve as destinations for **Reservations** that Users can make. Each Reservation records date, start time, and end time. To protect usability, the system must prevent duplication: a User is not allowed to book the same time slot for the same Gym twice (it will be handled by the backend logic).

Thus, a User can have multiple Membership over time and multiple Reservations, while a Gymnasium can accommodate many Reservations of different Users in parallel up to the limit of its capacity.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Blazor Server**:
we chose Blazor Server to implement the UI in full-stack C# mode. Blazor Server allows UI components to be rendered on the server, while maintaining a real-time SignalR connection with the browser: this makes the app highly responsive, with instant state updates without reloading the entire page. With Blazor Server, we directly share model classes and logic between frontend and backend, reducing code duplication and simplifying maintenance. Hosting on Azure App Service ensures automatic scalability and out-of-the-box security, while built-in Dependency Injection support facilitates testing and modular development.
- üé® **Bootstrap 5**:
to ensure a modern, responsive and consistent interface across all components, we integrated Bootstrap 5 into the design. Thanks to its grid system and utility classes, each adaptive LiftWise page scales perfectly on desktop, tablet and smartphone devices without the need to rewrite custom styles. The default components have been extended with a few custom classes to maintain a clean, professional style. With the intengrated JavaScript package, component animations can be handled without burdening the weight of the web app.
- üóÉÔ∏è **SQLite**:
we opted for SQLite as the database for the development environment and local demos because it requires zero server-side configuration, takes up very few resources, and offers surprisingly high performance for small- to medium-scale applications. In an eventual transition to SQL Server on Azure, the transition of the data model and queries is almost transparent.
- üå≥ **GitHub**:
we use GitHub as the main repository for code, facilitating system cooperation and versioning.
